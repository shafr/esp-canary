   <h1>404 Not found</h1>
   <p>
    The page you tried to access
    (/manager/mptfpimd)
    does not exist.
   </p>
   <p>
    The Manager application has been re-structured for Tomcat 7 onwards and some
    of URLs have changed. All URLs used to access the Manager application should
    now start with one of the following options:
   </p>
    <ul>
      <li>/manager/html for the HTML GUI</li>
      <li>/manager/text for the text interface</li>
      <li>/manager/jmxproxy for the JMX proxy</li>
      <li>/manager/status for the status pages</li>
    </ul>
   <p>
    Note that the URL for the text interface has changed from
    "/manager" to
    "/manager/text".
   </p>
   <p>
    You probably need to adjust the URL you are using to access the Manager
    application. However, there is always a chance you have found a bug in the
    Manager application. If you are sure you have found a bug, and that the bug
    has not already been reported, please report it to the Apache Tomcat team.
   </p>
